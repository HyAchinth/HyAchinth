# 👋 Hi, I’m Achinthya Sreedhar  
**AI/ML Engineer | Data Science & Analytics**

I work across the full machine learning lifecycle—**data ingestion, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, and monitoring**.  
My recent work focuses on **AI/ML engineering**, including MLOps pipelines, LLM workflows, agentic systems, and production-grade model deployment.  
But I also have a strong foundation in **experimentation, big data processing, classical ML, and deep learning**, allowing me to work across a wide range of analytics and engineering problems.

## 🔥 What I Work On
- **AI/ML Engineering:** LangChain, embeddings, GPT-based systems, semantic search, intelligent pipelines  
- **MLOps:** Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, scheduled retraining, model monitoring, CI/CD  
- **Machine Learning:** Tree models, ensemble methods, optimization, regularization, forecasting  
- **Deep Learning:** CNNs, transfer learning, MobileNet, computer vision pipelines  
- **Big Data:** Spark, Dataproc, BigQuery, distributed ETL over tens of millions of rows  
- **Analytics & Experimentation:** A/B testing, statistical inference, CATE analysis  
- **Backend Engineering:** FastAPI, distributed APIs, real-time pipelines  
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau dashboards, Python visualization, exploratory analysis
